 @brief Return the underlying HierarchicalStreamWriter implementation.
 <p>If a Converter needs to access methods of a specific HierarchicalStreamWriter implementation that are not
  defined in the HierarchicalStreamWriter interface, it should call this method before casting. This is because
  the writer passed to the Converter is often wrapped/decorated by another implementation to provide additional
  functionality (such as XPath tracking).</p>
  
 <p>For example:</p>
  @code
MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer; <b>// INCORRECT!</b>
  mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();
@endcode
  @code
MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer.underlyingWriter();  <b>// CORRECT!</b>
  mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();
@endcode
  
 <p>Implementations of HierarchicalStreamWriter should return 'this', unless they are a decorator, in which case
  they should delegate to whatever they are wrapping.</p>

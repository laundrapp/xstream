/*!
 @brief List that allows items to be added with a priority that will affect the order in which they are later iterated over.
 Objects with a high priority will appear before objects with a low priority in the list. If two objects of the same
  priority are added to the list, the most recently added one will be iterated over first. Implementation uses a
  TreeSet, which has a guaranteed add time of O(log(n)).

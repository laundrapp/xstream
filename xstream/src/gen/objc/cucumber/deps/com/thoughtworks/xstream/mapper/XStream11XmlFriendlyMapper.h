/*!
 @brief Mapper that ensures that all names in the serialization stream are read in an XML friendly way.
 <ul>
  <li><b>_</b> (underscore) chars appearing in class names are replaced with <b>$</b> (dollar)</li>
  <li><b>_DOLLAR_</b> string appearing in field names are replaced with <b>$</b> (dollar)</li>
  <li><b>__</b> string appearing in field names are replaced with <b>_</b> (underscore)</li>
  <li><b>default</b> is the prefix for class names with no package.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Note, this class is no longer in regular use for current XStream versions. It exists to provide backward compatibility
  to existing XML data written with older XStream versions (&lt;= 1.1).
